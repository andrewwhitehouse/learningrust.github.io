**Introduction**

The Rust programming language has grown rapidly in popularity over the past year.

The low level languages C and C++ consistently come at the top of the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) because developers value their speed in applications where performance is critical, such as cryptography, AI, and embedded systems.

Rust adds additional compiler checks and expressiveness to speed. 

The focus of this book is on Rust for cryptocurrency, specifically the Rust features used to build smart contracts. Choosing this application allows us to apply constraints on what we cover, to make the best use of your time. And the chapters are written in short pieces so that you can pick up the book when it is convenient for you, and still make meaningful progress.
