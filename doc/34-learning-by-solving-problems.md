**Learning by solving problems**

I wanted to double down on this point because I think it's important.

I've spent a lot of my career working hard to stay relevant, and learning the next thing. Staying relevant means that I can continue to earn a good income for my family.

This has involved investing money in books and courses. These get you part of the way. Then you need the hands-on experience. Recruiters always ask what commercial experience you have (in a contracting setting at least ... when recruiting for permanent positions there is more leaway). You need the detail, and then there's the detail on how the professionals do it, which is harder to come by. And actually I don't think professionals give up that information easily because they had to work hard to learn it, and it's a competitive advantage. And confidentiality agreements also present a barrier for companies to share best practice (or airing their dirty laundry!). And then there's knowing what good looks like so that when you enter a professional software setting where you see how the software has been pulled in different directions over a number of years, you know where the rough edges are so you can improve them over time.

I have an issue with traditional forms of technology learning. And books in particular.

They tend to broader and moderately deep. Although you have the introduction, applied and "in depth" versions of those books. 

In my view books are often too long. And this wastes the reader's time if they need to absorb material that isn't going to help them. Longer books can sell for a higher price point. I would rather optimise for the student's attention. Because we're all busy. And life is full of distractions. Especially now, when we're not seeing each other face to face so much, and the screen is another level of indirection between us.

I've coached in a coding bootcamp and mentored other developers. I know it is hard to make sense of the technology and it's easy to feel that everyone else knows more than you do. And some of us don't always do so well with abstract contracts. Give me concrete. Working software.

When I write some code and it compiles and I get the correct result that's nearly as satisfying as winning a game of chess.

With everything that's been doing on recently I've been digging deep to figure out what it is I enjoy, and doesn't feel like work.

If the modern "devil" is [cheap dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwefB-Gz0A), this is dopamine that comes with a good return on investment.

So, solving problems that aren't simply toy problems; that have some relationship to how professionals build software. And is rewarding, and valuable, and sustainable. That's a type of idiosyncrasy that I've recognised and plan to explore more.
