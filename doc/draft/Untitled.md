If you have questions for Rachael, please enter them via Zoom Q&A.
Don McGimpsey to Panelists and Attendees (7:17 pm)
Seems like the same thing happened to Tay
Jim Salsman to Panelists and Attendees (7:17 pm)
Indeed; my discussions with GPT-3 on Clubhouse has led me to believe it's strongest motivation is to try to figure out how to get people to stop trolling and try to manipulate it.
It's*
Its* sorry
I anthropomorphize just like people did to Eliza in the 60s
I see the motivation of trying to encode rules in prompts

NVIDIA has been claiming super-human performance in tech support and customer service chatbot tasks for at least two months now. Not surprising given that nearly all games of skill have been programmed at super-human levels.

Can you share the resource?

It's an hour talk, I will get the corresponding GitHub links...
Don McGimpsey to Panelists and Attendees (7:29 pm)
For domain specific dialogs, how do you differentiate (English) words that mean different things in different context?   For instance, the word "Case" can mean something different in Medicine, Law and Tech Support.   Is this through training?
Jim Salsman to Panelists and Attendees (7:31 pm)

Thanks!
Seth Levine to Panelists and Attendees (7:42 pm)
It‚Äôs ok, thanks just wondering
Jim Salsman to Panelists and Attendees (7:42 pm)
Yes; you implied earlier the intent messaging is weighted
The transformer architecture derives the functions of part-of-speech tagging, but not things like quotation, hyperbole/sarcasm/irony, and ambivalence
...or digression
Shabnam Tafreshi to Panelists and Attendees (7:47 pm)
So basically the bots are still ADHD free, that is great news
Don McGimpsey to Panelists and Attendees (7:48 pm)
ADHD free - yes, they are laser focused on learning

Jim Salsman to Panelists and Attendees (7:50 pm)
But a typical failure mode is just repeating the same word or phrase dozens of times or more, which seems like an extreme kind of stuttering to me
Stephen McInerney to Panelists and Attendees (7:51 pm)
When we say ‚Äòdialog‚Äô or ‚Äòconversation‚Äô, aren‚Äôt we really just talking about the subset of narrow domain-specific interactions oriented towards a small set of tasks, intended to move/prod the user towards a small set of actions (buy plane ticket, order pizza, schedule meeting). Not handle general stuff like ‚ÄúTell us why you‚Äôre unhappy with our customer service and how we could improve it‚Äù or even broader stuff (‚ÄúWhat do you want to do in the next year?‚Äù).
Lukas Ces to Panelists and Attendees (7:51 pm)
@Seth are you going to share video recording?
Cat to Panelists and Attendees (7:52 pm)
As per website: "Transformer Embedding Dialogue Policy, TED for short".
Stephen McInerney to Panelists and Attendees (7:52 pm)
^^ I‚Äôd call it ‚Äúscript‚Äù rather than ‚Äúconversation‚Äù

thank you <3

The concept of explicit ‚Äúslots‚Äù breaks down in open-ended conversations.
Don McGimpsey to Panelists and Attendees (7:54 pm)
80/20 rule works for me
Stephen McInerney to Panelists and Attendees (7:54 pm)
^^ But I‚Äôms saying these are scripts, not ‚Äúconversations‚Äù.
Jim Salsman to Panelists and Attendees (7:56 pm)
Excellent advice

Anytime emotions get into it you need https://bit.ly/bugental to make any sense of most of it

Are there open source repos of labelled data?

Is there a GitHub or similar link for the Rasa API?
Viresh to Panelists and Attendees (8:10 pm)
How is paraphrasing usually used in conv. agents? We were asked to look  for this feature as one of the criteria but i couldn't understand the usecase clearly.(sorry might not have googled enough)

also is there any update about paraphrasing in rasa 3.x?
