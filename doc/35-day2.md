**Advent of Code, Day 2 setup**

### Pre-amble

Apologies in advance if you find this post rather busy. I wanted to capture the feeling that coding can feel like "Whack-a-mole" (no moles were harmed in the making of this post) although we're aiming for fixed issues to stay fixed and not pop up somewhere else. I also learn by experimentation and getting to working code. 

I have colleagues who I feel can read and assimilate technical information. I find that I need to build things and see it working concretely in order to build up a mental model of how things fit together. There is a place in the coding world for people who aren't geniuses in abstract thinking. I learn differently ... I think it's called kinaesthetically.

Also, I believe that presenting a finished solution introduces a kind of bias into the learning process which skips over all of the mis-steps, misunderstandings and mis-guided assumptions that can be part of the learning process. When reading a post that gets directly from the starting point to the finished solution can add to the feeling of inadequacy some learners may feel when they have the perception that it's harder for them than it appears to be for their colleagues, and the authors, who give the impression that it's easier for them. I think that's unhelpful. 

Where I feel that I've done OK in this industry is that I am _really_ persistent, and I don't give up until I find the answer. There are some problems which aren't immediately reproducible though, and in those cases you need to add the prep work to make diagnosis easier the next time it happens. It reminds me of an issue I fixed which I'll tell you about in the next post.

### Code ...

Here's the puzzle <https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2>

We have a different focus today; parsing navigation instructions. Here are our imaginary submarine's movements, specified as a list of commands, one per line.

```
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
```

and maintain position in a two-dimensional space (forward and up/down).

Using the language of the problem description, let's model our "commands".

Note that depth is measures from the surface. (Measuring from the surface makes sense; it could become quite involved if we did it from the bottom, unless the bottom is flat, which it probably isn't.)

This was my first attempt ... get the data structures in place and add a failing test to make sure that the code at least compiles.

```
enum Direction {
    Forward,
    Up,
    Down
};

struct Command(Direction, u32);

pub fn parse(input: String) -> Vec<Command> {
    Vec::new()
}


#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_parse_day2() {
        let expected = vec!([Command {Forward, 3}, Command {Up, 5}, Command {Down, 10}]);
        assert_eq!(parse("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10"), expected);
    }
}
```

### Getting the tests to run

When I ran the tests only my day1 tests were picked up. 

I tried renaming a few things and still it didn't work. 

So I deleted the existing day1.rs and main.rs (they are under version control, so I can get them back) and then ran the tests. Nothing was picked up.

:thinking_face:

### Test Organisation

Here is the guidance on how to organise tests: <https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-unit-tests-really-be-put-in-the-same-file-as-the-source/62153> <https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-unit-tests-really-be-put-in-the-same-file-as-the-source/62153 which points to the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html).

Those docs aren't really helping me.

### "Integration" Tests?

As a side note, I found this comment in the Rust documentation on testing <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#library>

>Files located under the tests directory are integration tests. When you run cargo test, Cargo will compile each of these files as a separate crate, and execute them.

This is not what the generally accepted form of an integration test is.

Here is the example <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/integration_testing.html>

The documenter is using a different definition of integration test to the one I'm familiar with. Integeration tests are usually about confirming that different components work together, possibly including interactions with external systems. This example is more of a unit test, as it checks the result of adding two numbers.

This might sound picky, but it's going to be mis-leading or confusing for someone who is early in their career and doesn't know any better.

Here's [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html):

> Integration tests determine if independently developed units of software work correctly when they are connected to each other.

I would go so far as to say that the Rust docs' description is flat-out wrong.

### Problem: tests not found.

```
$ cargo test
error: failed to parse manifest at `/Users/andrewwhitehouse/code/aoc2021/Cargo.toml`

Caused by:
  no targets specified in the manifest
  either src/lib.rs, src/main.rs, a [lib] section, or [[bin]] section must be present
$
```

Stack Overflow to the rescue <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26946646/rust-package-with-both-a-library-and-a-binary>

So it looks like I need to add this for each day. But why didn't I need to do that for day 1?

## Solution: add bin section

```
[[bin]]
name = "day2"
path = "src/day2.rs"
```

Success (sort of ...)! Now I get plenty of errors ...

My university lecturer (who, remarkably is still lecturing on coding 35 years later) did used to say that a failing test is a successful test (because you've identified a bug).

### Problem

```
error: expected item, found `;`
 --> src/day2.rs:6:2
  |

6 | };
  |  ^ help: remove this semicolon
  |
  = help: enum declarations are not followed by a semicolon
```

### Solution: remove trailing semicolon

```
enum Direction {
    Forward,
    Up,
    Down
}
```

remove the semicolon.

### Problem: struct formatting

```
error: expected identifier, found `3`

  --> src/day2.rs:22:46
   |
22 |         let expected = vec!(Command{Forward, 3}, Command{Up, 5}, Command{Down, 10});
   |                             -------          ^ expected identifier
   |                             |
   |                             while parsing this struct
```

### Solution: use tuple formatting in test

I adopted the [tuple struct](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.9.0/book/structs.html) format, with unnamed attributes for the command. These use round brackets, not curly ones.

```
let expected = vec!([Command(Forward, 3), Command(Up, 5), Command(Down, 10)]);
```         

### Problem: accessing enum values from the test

```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `Up` in this scope
  --> src/day2.rs:20:59
   |
20 |         let expected = vec!([Command(Forward, 3), Command(Up, 5), Command(Down, 10)]);
   |                                                           ^^ not found in this scope
```

### Solution: import the enums into the test module

I added this to the tests (which are in a different module):

```
use crate::Direction::{Up,Down,Forward};
```    

### Problem: wrong string type specified

```
--> src/day2.rs:22:26
   |
22 |         assert_eq!(parse("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10"), expected);
   |                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^- help: try using a conversion method: `.to_strin
g()`
   |                          |
   |                          expected struct `String`, found `&str`
```

### Solution: convert to a String:

```
String::from("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10")
```

### Problem: constructing the test vector

```
--> src/day2.rs:22:9

   |
22 |         assert_eq!(parse(String::from("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10")), expected);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |         |
   |         Vec<Command>
   |         Vec<[Command; 3]>
   |
```

### Solution: don't use a nested array

I initialised my vector like this:

```
let expected = vec!([Command(Forward, 3), Command(Up, 5), Command(Down, 10)]);
```

Passing it a single array with 3 elements.

Should have been this:

```
vec!(Command(Forward, 3), Command(Up, 5), Command(Down, 10))
```

### Problem: comparing user-defined types

```
error[E0369]: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `Vec<Command>`
  --> src/day2.rs:21:9

   |
21 |         assert_eq!(parse(String::from("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10")), expected);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |         |
   |         Vec<Command>
   |         Vec<Command>
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace
 for more info)
```

How do we compare multi-element vectors?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29504514/whats-the-best-way-to-compare-2-vectors-or-strings-element-by-element

### Solution: add attributes to support comparison.

```
#[derive(PartialEq)]
enum Direction {
    Forward,
    Up,
    Down
}

#[derive(PartialEq)]
struct Command(Direction, u32);
```

### Problem: how to report/print user-defined types

```
error[E0277]: `Command` doesn't implement `Debug`
  --> src/day2.rs:23:9

   |
23 |         assert_eq!(parse(String::from("forward 3\nup 5\ndown 10")), expected);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Command` cannot be fo
rmatted using `{:?}`
   |
   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Command`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Command` or manually `impl Debug for Command`
```

### Solution: add the Debug attribute to Command.

```
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Command(Direction, u32);

pub fn parse(input: String) -> Vec<Command> {
    Vec::new()
}
```

And another:

```
error[E0446]: private type `Command` in public interface
  --> src/day2.rs:11:1

   |
9  | struct Command(Direction, u32);
   | ------------------------------- `Command` declared as private
10 |
11 | pub fn parse(input: String) -> Vec<Command> {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't leak private type
```

```
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub enum Direction {
    Forward,
    Up,
    Down,
}

#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct Command(Direction, u32);
```

### Problem: struct accessibility

```
error[E0446]: private type `Command` in public interface
  --> src/day2.rs:11:1
   |
9  | struct Command(Direction, u32);

   | ------------------------------- `Command` declared as private
10 |
11 | pub fn parse(input: String) -> Vec<Command> {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't leak private type
```

### Solution:

Make it public.

```
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct Command(Direction, u32);
```

### Finally ...

```

That was a lot of work for a failing test!

But now that we have a failing test, we can make it pass ...

One last thing; commit my changes.

`$ git add src`
`$ git commit -m "Add failing test for day2."`


**Update**: I nearly forgot to do the reflections.

There were quite a few steps involved in getting the code to work. While looking at how to organise the tests I came across Rust's definition of what are considered integration tests, and don't agree with their position.

To ensure that the tests were found in day1 and day2 I needed to add `[[bin]]` sections to Cargo.toml. I also needed to add one for the main file, and set a `default-run` name in the package section.

Enums shouldn't have a trailing semi-colon.

Structs take a tuple form and an attribute-based form. I chose the tuple form; with hindsight I think the other form is more readable.

When populating a vector with the `vec!` macro, the elements go into the argument list, rather than in a nested array.

Add the `PartialEq` attribute to user-defined types to support test assertions, and `Debug` as well, to enable printing of the results.
