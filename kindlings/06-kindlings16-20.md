[016 - Structure - Orderly](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-016-structure-orderly/66312)

What ideas will make up the substance of this book you are writing? How do they fit together? Would it be helpful to create a list or a mind map?

* Short chapters, with ample spacing for easy reading
* A code sample to type in and run on most chapters
* Sharing my observations as I'm learning a language too, not as an existing "expert"
* Interesting examples
* Occasional surprises
* How Rust brings speed and good memory management
* Towards an applied goal: creating Serverless functions(?)

[017 - Audience - Telling Their Friends](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-017-audience-telling-their-friends/66330)

> So far we have talked about the [one person](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-003-audience-just-one/64557) who must read your book and who they will [become](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-010-audience-becoming/65388) as they read your book. Here’s the question for this week: when they finish reading your book, what will they tell their friends?

I found a little book on Rust. It was quite fun actually. And now I can use it for Serverless; the functions are lightning fast, and I see more jobs being advertised with Rust. It's not easy to learn so the jobs are well paid.

>David Whyte doesn’t sound like other poets. Krista Tippett doesn’t sound like other podcasters. Stephen King doesn’t sound like other writers – even when he wrote with a pen name, people figured it out.

>What would it mean to sound like you?

I can share my experience of using other languages. And recognise the trade offs between them. And encourage them ... that it's OK to go through a stage where you feel like you don't know enough. "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn."

[019 - Tension - Relief at the End](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-019-tension-relief-at-the-end/66332)

> What tension will be relieved for the reader at the end of the book?

I don't have a clear answer on this one, which is telling in itself.

Is a [smart contract](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro) a good choice?

Something [here](https://research.mozilla.org/rust/).

[020 - Tactics - A Tiny Frame](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-020-tactics-a-tiny-frame/66333)

>The words are yours and yours alone to write, but you don’t have to do it by yourself. That’s what writing in community is all about. There are hundreds of folks in this space writing alongside you.
>
>You are also accompanied by the wisdom of so many authors who came before you. Over the next few weeks, we’ll explore some of their tactics each Saturday. Here’s Anne Lamott in Bird by Bird on the one inch picture frame:
>
>>I go back to trying to breathe, slowly and calmly, and I finally notice the one-inch picture frame that I put on my desk to remind me of short assignments.
>>
>>It reminds me that all I have to do is to write down as much as I can see through a one-inch picture frame. This is all I have to bite off for the time being. All I am going to do right now, for example, is write that one paragraph that sets the story in my hometown, in the late fifties, when the trains were still running. I am going to paint a picture of it, in words, on my word processor. Or all I am going to do is to describe the main character the very first time we meet her, when she first walks out the front door and onto the porch. I am not even going to describe the expression on her face when she first notices the blind dog sitting behind the wheel of her car–just what I can see through the one-inch picture frame, just one paragraph describing this woman, in the town where I grew up, the first time we encounter her.
>>
>>E. L. Doctorow once said that “writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” You don’t have to see where you’re going, you don’t have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice about writing, or life, I have ever heard.

I'm writing in short increments like this. It feels like I still have a long way to go.
