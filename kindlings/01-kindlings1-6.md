**Revisiting Kindlings**

I have a sense that these kindlings are really valuable ... I've allowed them to slide somewhat while I figure out what this book is going to be.

I thought it might be a guided tutorial for the annual Advent of Code challenge. These are useful for teaching algorithms, but they are somewhat of a diversion and I'm not sure that they would be the thing that developers want to learn most. And they weren't fun.

And then I thought: I could write a book about the various things that I know, but those topics don't get me excited either. I want to break new ground.

And the content needs to be something I'm sufficiently motivated to pursue while life is going on. And it needs to be differentiated so I don't need to work quite as hard to stand out from all the other coding tutorials. And it needs to be relevant.

So I went for a coding tutorial in a new language that it gaining traction and could be highly popular with cryptocurrency applications: Rust. I don't know this language yet so I'm writing the book from the perspective of someone to which the techniques are new. (Note to self: I told myself that I would cover principles too, as well as specific techniques. I don't think I'm highlighting these quite enough yet.)

I'm revisiting the kindlings from the start with the renewed perspective of this book.

I've found it easier to be clear on these with hindsight, once I've tried a few things and then settled on something that seems to be working.

[01 - Genre](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-001-genre-where-does-your-book-go/63443)

> Imagine for a second a room filled with books. The books have been carefully selected and assembled across a lifetime of reading.
>
>Imagine that all the books you’ve read and referenced and loved are there.
>
>Now imagine that the book you are currently writing is in your hands. Where would you place it? What two books does yours go between on the book shelf?

It might be between:

- [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01EAW7XXU/); and
- [Classic Computer Science Problems](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Classic-Computer-Science-Problems-Python/dp/1617295981) or the [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628) or [Learn Enough (Ruby)](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-tutorial) but with more code.

Actually I'm going to opt for The C Programming Language and an amalgam of Learn Enough Ruby with [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex5.html) and **update** [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#babys-first-functions) with shorter chapters.

 [Introduction to Tactics](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/introduction-to-tactics-kindlings/63440)

>Is there a tactic that helps you get the writing done? Maybe it’s showing up to write at the same time each day or first writing by hand or setting a timer for 5 minutes. Please share in your Kindlings response thread.

It needs to be on a topic that is sustainable, differentiated and relevant. I tend to think of where the in-demand skills are going, and learning new things interests me.

Because I'm unfamiliar with the material I need to do some reading first ... I have a reference point that gives me structure for the material, which I can digest and then let my brain go to work. I used to find writing in the morning helpful. Now I need to do the initial reading/learning and then let the ideas form. 

Picking a format with short chapters is working for me because I can see discernible units of progress, and I'm not getting bogged down with one point or technique for too long. I believe that may resonate with my readers too, and there is precedent already with apps that teach this way doing rather well.

This book is about applied learning. At the end of it the person will have covered enough to understand the elements of a blockchain "smart contract" that they programme.

The chapters are short because I intend to adapt the content for an online tutorial with small increments, and exercises.

>Let’s begin with an audience of one.

>Who is the one person that must read your book? Why?

This person has seen the potential of blockchain applications, but they are unimpressed with the current tools available and have seen how the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ecosystem might play a part in how this evolves, whether through specific blockchains, or [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

It's also for someone who has limited time, and many distractions, so the chapters need to be short and rewarding.

This is the book that I would have wanted to read before I decided to learn Rust.

>What are books for?

I have a job that I want to get done; there is a particular skill set -- just enough -- that will enable me to either get a job (historically, this has been the priority), or build a product and create something new that didn't exist before.

I also enjoy the feeling of growth that comes from learning new things. In truth, there's probably an element of fear too ... _got to stay relevant, and employable_ ... the scarcity mindset was certainly visible in our family when I was growing up.

Books are for enabling us to do things we didn't know how to do before, and to act as positive triggers for our brains.

[Tactics - You Can Never Be Sure](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-006-tactics-you-can-never-be-sure/64560)

>Are you willing to let go of being sure? What would this look like for you?

Even if it sells zero copies, I've learned a new language and published a book. I suspect it may do better than zero though.
