> Whatâ€™s a book that someone who picks up yours will have read?

Perhaps [The Little Schemer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Schemer-MIT-Press/dp/0262560992/) for the problem solving approach in small steps. 

Or The C Programming Language, because Rust is a safer C. Perhaps [Learning WebAssembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust/) for the applied problem solving angle. 

Perhaps O'Reilly's programming Rust. 

Or they don't like long-form books. 

Anyone who's read the [official Rust books](https://lborb.github.io/book/official.html) and found them rather dry.

Eloquent JavaScript ... at a stretch.

Possible [Brian Hogan's books](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding/dp/1680501224/).

to be continued ...

**Update**: perhaps they like typed languages, like Scala or Haskell. Or they've read books on crypto-currency.
