[_I'm off to the cinema to see West Side Story this evening, in a beautiful restored Art Deco cinema. So I've decided to catch up with Kindlings, which feels rather rushed, and I won't benefit from reading the others who wrote theirs back in November ..._]

**Five Kindlings - 9 to 15**

# [Kindling 009 - Structure - Keep It Simple](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-009-structure-keep-it-simple/65387)

>If you were to think about the structure of your book as simply as you possibly could, what would the elements be?
>
>Of course, you’ll probably end up rearranging things. Perhaps starting somewhere else or ending up in a different spot. Expect that you’ll reorganize.
>
>Now, take a pass at what a simple structure for your book might look like.

I'm following the [Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) with a focus on writing Serverless functions, which are now supported by Amazon.

Rust's focus on performance and memory management are a good fit for Amazon's pricing model.

If there's anything not needed for Serverless, I'm going to leave that out in the first pass.

Here are the section (groups):

# [Kindling 010 - Audience - Becoming](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-010-audience-becoming/65388)

> Last week we talked about the [one person ](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-003-audience-just-one/64557) who must read your book.
>
>Now let’s imagine that the one person who must read your book arrives at the last page.

>What do they have? Who did they become?

They have the ability to understand enough Rust so that they can create serverless functions in Rust on Amazon Web Services. And they are motivated to go and try.

# [Kindling 011 - Idiosyncratic - Another Favorite](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-011-idiosyncratic-another-favorite/65389)

>[Last week ](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-004-idiosyncratic-like-you/64558) we each talked about the voice of a person we admire.
>
>Pick another favorite voice. What makes them sound like them?

Bruce Eckel, who wrote [Thinking in Java](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Java-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486/) the book that helped me "get" Java.

He's not flashy, but he is methodical and uses simple language with examples that make sense.

Bonus: Douglas Hofstadter's [Bach Godel Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) which is slightly whimsical and brings together different themes like music and logic and art.

# [Kindling 012 - Tension - For What Part II](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-012-tension-for-what-part-ii/65390)

> [Last week ](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-005-tension-for-what/64559) we reflected on what books are for.
>
>Now, how about your book? What is your book for?

My book is to guide a coder through the process of learning Rust, and the new concepts, while experiencing success through working code. It's to help coders learn by doing, in small increments, which works better for those who aren't so good with words, or are easily distracted.

To experience the little ping of dopamine when they write some code that works.

# [Kindling 013 - Tactics - Timed](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-013-tactics-timed/65391)

> The words are yours and yours alone to write, but you don’t have to do it by yourself. That’s what writing in community is all about. There are hundreds of folks in this space writing alongside you.
>
>You are also accompanied by the wisdom of so many authors who came before you. Over the next few weeks, we’ll explore some of their tactics each Saturday.
>
>We’ll start with Natalie Goldberg on timed writing:
>
>> Writing is the act of discovery. If you want something alive, try this, too: write ten, ten-minute timed writings about your father during a week’s time. The crazier the better. And if your mind goes to onions, trucks, ocean, straws, black shoes, don’t fight it. Follow that trail. See where it leads. What seems illogical often can take you to deeper, more fertile ground about your father. Also don’t worry if you repeat yourself.
>>
>>
>>
>> Then a week later, reread all ten writings. Time lets the blood dry. You can see more clearly what you have written. You aren’t as attached. The places where you were present almost glow off the page. It’s obvious. Pull those out and see what you have. And the stuff that doesn’t glow? Let it go. Our writing isn’t that precious…
>>
>>
>>
>> You know what to do: pick up the pen and write. You have to physically do it. Not *think* about it. An idea is not enough. You have to act.
>
>If you were to write ten, ten-minute timed writings in a week, what would you write them about? Is this an experiment you’d like to try?
>
>If so, what new memories, insights, words, ideas might appear on the page? What might you happily toss out? What are you eager to include? Where might you go deeper?

Ooh, this one's interesting:

- jobs I've had
- family members
- what I know about my Dad
- the ten most important things I think my children need to know
- my ten favourite tunes, and why I like them
- (I like lists)

# [Kindling 015 - Genre - Before Yours](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kindling-015-genre-before-yours/65393)

>What book had to be written before yours could come into the world?

[_I was stuck on this and so had a look to see what @wintreese [wrote](https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/win-treese-wic3-kindlings-history-of-random-numbers/65432/12)_]

It could be [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Pearls-Joe-Bentley/dp/8177588583/) because there is a heavy focus on problem solving. Or [Learn Enough Ruby (to be dangerous)](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-tutorial), or The C Programming Language, which teaches the language with plenty of examples. 

[Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex4.html) validated that there is a market for books with minimal explanation.

And Seth Godin (e.g. The Dip) made it OK to write books that aren't padded unnecessarily with umpteen anecdotes.
