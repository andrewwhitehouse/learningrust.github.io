**Sunday Reflection**

[_I left it late in the day to write after doing a number of things around the house, and frankly I don't have the energy for the creative writing. So I'm doing this instead._]

**What are you noticing?**

I tried something different this week ... including a section about test-driven development, which I don't think belongs in the writing until I can re-frame the introduction, and make it clearly about _principles_, and the trade offs we make when adopting a language. I need to think about that some more.

Also I get frazzled during the day -- more so since having COVID in November, so I need to ensure that my routine allows for that. 

Work continues to be mad, so it's quite an effort to keep the momentum here.

**What went well? What were the hard parts?**

I established some momentum. 

I also added a section that wasn't _only_ about the language, and given that I'm aiming for conciseness and _just enough_ I am not sure yet if this was a good idea. The best part of the day for writing is the morning before everyone gets up, or in the evening directly after work, where I can transition from the day job to the writing.

**What do you want to celebrate?**

Momentum. Enjoying the process. Seeing others make good progress with their books.

**What might you try next week?**

I'm going to re-frame the test-driven section to be a discussion about correctness, and how types help you get some of the way ... but there are still some gaps. It may need to be further on in the book though ... I can allude to the requirements/constraints we must recognise though.

**As of today, how would you summarize your book in a sentence?**

Learn enough Rust to build useful projects.

I'm in two minds now as to whether it should be blockchain-only. I see that Amazon are supporting Rust for AWS Lambda, which could be a really good fit.
