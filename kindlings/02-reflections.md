**Sunday Reflection**

**What are you noticing?**

This short, practical, learn-a-new-thing format that I can convert to a guided tutorial is so far working pretty well.

**What went well? What were the hard parts?**

I have momentum -- six chapters so far -- so I think that's going to keep me going.

The hard parts are remaining committed to it even when other factors are willing me to take a night off. I wasn't clear when I started who my audience was. But then I started writing for me, and I hope there will be people like me who enjoy it.

**What do you want to celebrate?**

I didn't get very far in WIC1. It took me nearly three months of thrashing around to get to something I could sustain.

**What might you try next week?**

It's a technical point but I'll try introducing more rigour around how we test programmes. That might make the posts too weighty. I'm not sure.

Try a multiple-choice option in the exercise.

Make a list of interesting puzzles to explore.

**As of today, how would you summarize your book in a sentence?**

Learn enough Rust to code Solana smart contracts.

**Shoutouts and Shares: This is a chance to @ tag someone(s) who supported you or cheered you on or who showed up generously this week. Do you appreciate someone for being part of this community? This is a chance to let them know!**

Thanks to @wintreese  for showing up consistently and sharing valuable feedback on my writing. I know this stuff may not be very accessible to the community so it's much appreciate to have someone who gives this support.

And to @leannegordon  and @Louise  who have given me feedback in the past when I've asked for it, which I have remembers and helps me to choose more fruitful paths.
